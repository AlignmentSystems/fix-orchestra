# FIX Orchestra

FIX Orchestra is intended to provide a standard and some reference implementation for machine readable rules of engagement between counterparties. FIX Orchestra makes use of [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) technologies.

## Status
This project is a **prototype**. Requirements are still being gathered and discussed by the FIX Orchestra working group. Participation in the working group is encouraged by FIX Trading Community members, and more broadly, feedback is welcome from interested GitHub users.

## Modules

### Session Configuration
This module allows counterparties to discover configurations of sessions between them. Direct support is supplied for FIXT sessions (the traditional FIX session layer) as well as FIXP, the FIX performance session layer. The prototype also demonstrates how session definitions could be extended to cover non-FIX protocols, such as NASDAQ OUCH.
